 Rotational Shot Put Technique The rotational shot put is divided into four main components; the start, the movement across the ring, the power position, and the delivery. Starting Position The thrower faces the back of the circle with the feet shoulder width apart, and the knees bent. The upper body will have some forward tilt, similar to the position in a back squat. Both arms are elevated overhead in the starting position; then, the shot is placed above the right shoulder. The wrist is bent facing upward, with the shot resting on the base of the fingers. The shot is then lowered onto the neck and placed near the ear with the elbow out. The left arm is extended out, in line with the center of the chest. There are different types of shot put placement positions between throwers; typically, for the rotational shot put, the ball is under the ear; some throwers hold it closer to the chin, like most gliders, but it is more common for the ball to be placed further back on the neck with the rotational technique. Coaching Note: ball placement in the rotational shot put is different than the glide shot put. With the glide technique, the shot is placed near the chin with the elbow down to help keep the ball in a linear path during the movement. The wind up id started with the upper body rotating toward the right side, the change in weight distribution should be controlled during the wind up to develop consistency in the technique. The rhythm pattern of the throw is established during the wind up. The thrower should focus on rotating the upper body with minimal weight shift of the lower body. The rotational shot put requires very little wind up when compared to the discus throw. The wind up can cause problems with balance and consistency; therefore, a static start or a minimal wind up is recommended for novice throwers in the rotational shot put technique. Coaching Note: the throwers can take static start throws without a wind up to reduce movement and eliminate the chance of starting the throw off balance. Static start throws can be a good warm up before more dynamic starts in the rotational shot put. Rotational Movement The body weight is shifted to the left leg and dropping the knee down over the toe, then the right leg is picked up to start the momentum building phase of the throw. When the left foot reaches 90 degrees, the right leg is lifted up from the hip and knee. After the right foot is off the ground, the right side sweeps across the body, the knee and inside of the foot will lead the lower body. A long, high sweeping action of the right leg around the outer edge of the circle will create a greater distance between the left foot and right toe during the sweep in the back of the circle, which will result in greater rotary momentum. The left knee should be angled downward with the knee over the pushed over the toe during the sweeping movement. The upper body should remain level and passive with the left arm inside the left knee to maintain balance and create separation during the sweeping action in the back of the circle. Drive to The Middle After the right leg sweeps around the outside of the circle, the right foot drives across the ring into the middle of the circle. The right leg penetrates the ring with a powerful drive upward as it accelerates forward. Coaching Note: one common style is to drive the inside of the right foot to the middle, like a soccer kick; this will help the thrower drive forward and reduce over rotating past the middle of the ring. The left leg should stay down with the knee bent, ready to push off toward the front of the circle as the right legs move toward the front of the circle. The shoulders should remain level during the drive to the middle; the shot stays behind the right hip, and the left arm extended left arm while remaining inside the left knee. Coaching Note: the thrower should think 'push off' with the left leg when the right leg starts to go forward after sweeping around the back of the circle. Power Position Set Up As the right leg moves past the middle of the ring, the right hip and foot should be pre-turned to set up the landing position. The left leg actively pushes off out of the back of the circle; the thrower will bring the knees together in the middle of the circle to help develop more velocity and create more torque in the power position. The shot remains behind the hip as the right foot touches down past the middle of the circle. The shot can rise up slightly into the middle of the circle, similar to the high point in the discus, just not an extreme. The left arm will drop down into the middle of the circle, slowing down the upper body creating additional separation from the lower body. Into the Power Position The right foot will contact the center of the circle between 280 to 340 degrees, while the left foot is airborne near 90 degrees. Once the right foot has made contact, it must continue to rotate, turning on the ball of the foot. The left leg should be aggressively planted in the front of the circle. The shot should remain behind the right foot, and the left arm should stay down until the left foot touches in the front of the ring. Once the left foot touches down, the main acceleration phase of the throw begins. The largest gains in implement velocity occur after the thrower reaches the power position. Even in single support (one foot on the ground), the right side should keep turning; when the left foot plants, the right foot should be approximately 90 degrees. The acceleration of the shot and body movements during the preparation phase and momentum building phase set up an active throwing position to effectively apply force into the shot during the delivery of the throw. Power Position Movement The thrower actively turns and lifts the right side into the left side of the lower body to create a blocking action. The right side lifts and turns toward the front of the circle while the thrower keeps the shot behind the hip. The left arm opens up to the center of the sector to set up the final blocking action of the left side during the release. Most of the bodyweight should stay centered during the lifting and turning action prior to the release. Coaching Note: the thrower will have some weight shift forward from the power position into the release. The thrower must keep the weight back over the right side as long as possible during the lifting action before the delivery phase. The power position base is narrower in the rotational shot put. The same heel-to-toe relationship as in the glide shot put technique is required to allow the hips to open up during the delivery phase.Delivery The right side of the body extends upward to complete the throw as the left side blocks. The thrower explosively lifts off the ground, the horizontal momentum created by driving across the ring is now converted into vertical velocity. The put is completed by lifting the shot upward then out over the toeboard; during the arm strike, the elbow is high, and the thumb is down. The left arm is pulled in toward the shoulder as the chest is driven up during the blocking action. The vertical lift increases the height of release and sets up the recovery action after the release. After the put is completed, the thrower will perform a reverse, bringing the right foot forward to the front of the ring after the shot is released. The right foot is planted flat and parallel throwing area; then the thrower can rotate around the right foot or execute other movements to stay in the ring. Corrective actions such as lowering the center of gravity or guiding the body away from the throwing sector can redirect the thrower's momentum to assist with recovery after the release of the shot.




Simple Keys to the Rotational Technique Wondering what you can do for a simple fix to any issues in your spin? Have a couple of technical breakdowns within the shot put rotational technique that you are confused by? You are struggling to find that groove and fix your technical errors? Check out the simple keys we focus on to keep the technique simple! Basics Before we dive into the keys around the rotational technique, let’s cover some very basic ideas and concepts that will enhance your comprehension of the shot put. For the purpose of this article, we will be referring to all parts of the body as though we are discussing a right-handed thrower. If you are coaching a left-handed thrower or you are a left-handed thrower, just flip the side of the body we are referring to. The basic technical concept we focus on is based around a rotational movement with a grounded finish. Try to change the mindset and method that you use to think of the spin. Start to view and understand the spin as a side around side movement. In simple terms, the right leg will rotate around the left side out of the back, the left side will rotate around the right side in the middle and the right side will rotate around the left side on the finish! When this simple concept is reinforced over and over again, the athlete can comprehend how to use BOTH sides of the body and every limb as a major contributor to the entire movement. The Back When referring to the back in the rotational shot put technique, we are discussing the starting position all the way to the long leg sweep to the center. The goal out of the back of the circle is to initiate the throw. Start with a basic and simple winding position, the left arm will get in line with the right leg and then open the left shoulder. As the left shoulder opens long, out past the left leg, the left hip will begin to open. When the left hip and knee and foot open to 90 degrees, 70% of the weight of the body should be over the left side. This is the point when the right leg will be used to push force into the ground and lead to a wide right leg sweep. As the right leg picks up, the high point of the right foot will be very dependent upon the individual. The goal of the right side is to achieve a long sweep position with a dorsiflexed foot and a knee cap pointing to the sky. This lengthened position will help the groin get lengthened just prior to sweeping to the center of the circle! As the right leg sweeps past the left leg, the left leg will pick up and begin to sweep to the front and that is where we enter the middle of the circle! The Middle One concept that is NEVER discussed or taught is the concept of a secondary sweep leg. The secondary sweep leg is the left leg passing the right side in the middle. This secondary sweep leg becomes the primary mover through the middle of the circle. When thinking and analyzing technique from a side around side perspective, the left side becomes active while the right side holds. When the right leg grounds, the right ANKLE must be stiff and the right knee must be flexed. Ideally, there will be a line from the foot to the knee to the chest while the left arm holds either across the body or toward the back of the circle. By holding strong trunk tension, a stiff ankle and a stiff knee, the right side sets up as a passive point of rotation. This rotation will be guided by the action of the left leg to the front. As the left leg sweeps to the front, the hip will begin to open just prior to grounding. The Front The final position of the throw is in the front of the circle. As the left leg is rotating to the front of the circle, the left arm is holding and the right side has massive tension in the shoulder. JUST PRIOR to the left leg grounding, the left arm opens long toward the sector, there is a massive stretch across the chest from the left arm into the right shoulder. The right knee and right ankle will hold tension and flexion into the concrete and when the left foot lands, the shot should still be behind the right hip. When the left leg grounds, about 70% of the weight will be on the right foot and 30% will be on the left foot. As the left side opens and the right side starts to rotate forward, the percentage will shift where 70-80% of the load will go into the left foot. The goal is to keep the right side grounded as long as possible while the left leg is semi-bent and the left foot is nearly flat. This creates a perfect point of deceleration as the right side accelerates rapidly. Remember that the side around side movement is key on the finish. The finish also needs to utilize the left arm, the right shoulder, the left leg as a point of deceleration, and a strong tension into a right leg for an optimal rotation! Recap By comprehending the throw from a side around side movement, the technique becomes easier to comprehend and the movement is triggered by ALL FOUR limbs in the throw. By using all four limbs to execute a throw, throwers become more coordinated and more precise in their movement. This ultimately leads to greater comprehension of technique and longer throws!






Rotational Shot Put Technique Explained March 24, 2021 The shot put event originates from heavy stone throwing competitions in England and Scotland during the 15th century and was included in the first modern Olympiad of 1896 in Athens. Today there are two main techniques used, a linear movement which is a backwards shift across the circle and the non-linear or rotational technique. Advert Think of all throws having three phases, a beginning, middle and end and in each phase there are several sections. In the case of the following linear technique the beginning is the stand and sit followed by the middle, the glide and turn, and the end is the delivery. For the rotational shot the beginning is the pre-flight, the middle the take off and transition and the end is the release Within these sections are the behaviour goals we are looking to achieve in pursuit of good technique. The key to being successful at both techniques is to develop good rhythm i.e.1-2,3 turn the feet and punch the shot, with the angle of delivery slightly lower in the rotational shot The following sequences are written for a right-handed thrower (12 o’clock is the back of the circle, so the front is 6) Pre-Flight Stand at the back of the circle facing 12 with feet just slightly more than shoulder width apart Hold the shot in the right hand with an even finger spread with thumb on downside Do not hold in the palm of the hand, but instead on the fingers The elbow of the throwing arm should be at shoulder height in the 12/3 position i.e. face & chest looking at 12 and the elbow pointing to 3 Think neck-ball-elbow in line (shot is often held a tad higher in the neck than with the linear technique) Maintaining this position until delivery will help the force generated go in the direction of the throw Slowly shift body weight onto the right foot rotating the shoulders so the right elbow is pointing between 6 & 7 and the shoulders are parallel to the ground Then allow body weight to pivot back onto the left foot (toes) and move to 80–90% of normal height i.e. move from high to low shifting body weight from the right foot to the left foot by actively turning the left foot Don’t lead with the left arm, instead allow the right leg to come around the body Right foot needs to be picked up before the right shoulder passes Keep the right shoulder behind the right hip Take Off Long sweeping right leg into the flight phase Wider radius gives better angular momentum at take off Increase height in flight phase will mean dropping onto the right leg will require good leg strength Lead the right foot forward into a step forward Don’t look down at feet, instead use a personal horizon Push off the left foot and step into middle of circle (falling) with gaze looking forward Trunk is more upright than glide technique Transition At rear (right) foot touch down the right knee needs to be greatly flexed and grounds the foot causing athlete to both turn and lift while in single support The shorter the time between rear foot touch down & front (left) foot touch down will allow maximal effort, too early or late will result in inefficient use of power Once the right foot lands keep it turning throughout the throw and allow the left leg to come underneath and ground. i.e. sweep the left (block) leg back on the turn (knees should pass by close together) The left foot needs to be grounded with the rhythm of 1-2,3 Then allow the right foot to continue moving until shot is 180ْ   from release at which point drop the left heel to form the block 70-80% of release velocity achieved in final delivery, so this movement needs to be very explosive and fast Important that the head remains passive so that shoulders and trunk rotate around the head (core movement) do not strike with the head Release The block leg should be stiff on delivery Horizontal release point needs to be as far in front of the stop board as possible without falling (20-40cm for elite athletes) Optimal angle of release Elite 42% Higher the angle reduces the release velocity Research suggests 32-38 is best angle Because of the forces generated, most athletes have to perform a reverse by bringing the right foot forward just after the critical point of the delivery to ensure the throw is not fouled.

The rotational technique, also known as the "spin" or "rotational spin," in shot put is an advanced throwing style that leverages the principles of rotational motion to generate more power and achieve a longer throw. This method is preferred by many elite shot putters because it allows for the generation of angular momentum, which can translate into greater linear speed during the release of the shot. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the rotational shot put technique:
1. Preparation and Stance
Starting Position: The athlete begins at the back of the throwing circle, typically facing the rear of the circle, with their back towards the throwing direction.
Foot Position: The feet are shoulder-width apart, with the right foot (for a right-handed thrower) slightly ahead of the left. The weight is predominantly on the right foot.
Shot Position: The shot is held in the throwing hand, resting against the neck and underneath the jaw. The elbow is kept high, and the non-throwing arm is used for balance.
2. Wind-Up and Initiation of Rotation
Initial Wind-Up: The athlete performs a slight backward movement (rocking motion) to create momentum and coil their body. This involves turning the torso and bending the knees to lower the center of gravity.
Rotation Start: The right leg initiates the turn. The athlete pivots on the ball of the right foot while simultaneously driving the left leg to the left, creating a powerful rotational movement. The left arm helps to lead the body in the rotation.
3. Drive Across the Circle
Rotation in the Center: As the thrower spins, they transfer weight from the right leg to the left leg. The right leg drives across the circle, while the left leg helps maintain balance and continues the rotational movement.
Maintaining Low Position: The athlete stays low to the ground with bent knees, enabling a powerful upward push later on. The torso remains coiled to store rotational energy.
Right Foot Pivot: The right foot lands near the center of the circle, pivoting quickly to face the throwing direction, while the left leg extends outward for balance.
4. Power Position Setup
Positioning for Release: As the right foot lands, the athlete shifts into the "power position." In this phase, the right leg is bent and ready to drive upward, while the left foot is grounded for stability.
Hips and Shoulders Alignment: The torso remains coiled, with the shoulders still facing away from the throwing direction. The hips begin to rotate ahead of the shoulders to "unwind" the stored rotational energy.
Left Arm Guidance: The left arm is used as a guide, moving towards the target to help maintain balance and add to the rotational force.
5. Delivery and Release
Explosive Hip Rotation: The athlete explosively uncoils the hips, followed by the shoulders, as they drive the right leg upward and push off with the left leg. The shot is propelled forward using the entire body's momentum.
Arm Extension: The throwing arm extends fully as the shot is released. The wrist flicks to add extra spin to the shot, helping it travel in a stable trajectory.
Angle of Release: The ideal release angle for the shot is typically around 37-42 degrees, maximizing distance. The athlete’s head remains up, and their focus is on the throwing direction.
6. Follow-Through
Maintaining Balance: After the release, the athlete continues to rotate their body, stepping forward with the left foot to maintain balance and avoid fouling the throw.
Controlled Landing: The right foot lands first in the throwing area, followed by the left to prevent stepping outside the circle.
Key Elements for Success
Footwork and Balance: Proper footwork is essential in the rotational technique. Maintaining balance while generating rotation is crucial for a powerful throw.
Core Strength: A strong core helps in generating and transferring rotational energy efficiently.
Speed of Rotation: Faster rotational speed increases the shot’s velocity at release, enhancing throw distance.
Angle and Timing: The correct release angle and timing of hip and shoulder rotation are critical to maximizing the throw's distance.
The rotational technique requires significant coordination and practice but can produce greater distances than the traditional glide technique when executed correctly.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this manual is to help promote, highlight and develop
quality techniques for officiating interscholastic track and field. The
manual is a compilation of effort by many well-experienced and
knowledgeable track and field officials. It resulted from their willingness
to share their expertise and experiences as well as their ability to put it in
writing. The creation of the manual has been a labor of love and
appreciation is extended to all who contributed to this worthy effort.
PIAA believes all interscholastic track and field officials will find this
manual beneficial. Please use it to further enhance your knowledge of
the rules and to develop your officiating techniques. In addition, we
strongly encourage you to review the NFHS Track & Field Officials’
Manual as a primary source for information regarding track and field
officiating.

MEET MANAGEMENT and REFEREE
I. Though it may appear redundant, the most effective manner to
handle disputes is to minimize or eliminate the probable cause.
A. Careful planning is essential. Meet site, times, dates,
conditions and instructions must be communicated to all
concerned in ample time by meet management.
B. Facilities must be examined well ahead of competition. This
shall include the track, lane markings, exchange zones, with
special emphasis placed upon the tracks that have been
newly surfaced. Each of the field facilities should be
examined with the safety of each contestant the prime
concern.
C. All potential areas of concern or misunderstanding should be
covered during the pre-meet conference with coaches and
captains. The jewelry and uniform rules should be reviewed
along with emphasis on the expectation of good
sportsmanship.
II. During the pre-meet conference in dual meets, those matters,
which may and those, which may not be appealed, should be
explained. In larger meets, such as invitational, conference, district
and state championships, a separate meeting with coaches
covering those matters should be held.
A. Those situations subject to appeal include misapplication of
the rules (such written appeal to be filed within thirty minutes
after the announcement of event results), correction of clerical
or team scoring, correction of meet results involving an
ineligible participant, failure to follow stated procedures
previously announced, including time schedules, number of
heats, trials, competitors who advance, etc.
- 1 -
B. Matters not subject to appeal include judgments of officials
relating to lane violations, false starts, hurdling infractions,
jumping and throwing infractions, unsportsmanlike behavior
or other violations of the rules.
III. When officials report an infraction, make sure he/she has specific
information presented in writing on forms provided which shall
include:
A. Contestant number, uniform color, event, team or name if this
occurs during a dual meet where numbers are not used.
B. Nature of violation, i.e. lane violation, hurdle infraction, lap
number, etc.
C. Secure confirmation by another official, if possible.
D. Check with automated equipment personnel, if pertinent.
E. This information is to be presented to the referee for his/her
decision.
IV. If the referee determines that the infraction warrants
disqualification, the following is recommended:
A. Before the results are announced, meet with the contestant
or at least one member of a relay team if that is the event in
question. Such meeting should take place in a calm,
professional manner and should be private (away from the
maddening crowd).
B. Direct the contestant to inform his/her coach immediately to
explain the ruling.
C. If the coach requests, the referee will meet with him/her to
answer reasonable questions and review with him/her that
which may and/or may not be appealed.
- 2 -
D. If a legitimate appeal is filed, meeting the stated criteria, the
Jury of Appeals may be called into session. Under such
circumstances, the referee will make available all pertinent
information, which was considered when rendering his/her
ruling.
E. Points to keep in mind:
a. Be friendly, not buddy-buddy, informative and
remember, everyone is under stress. Stay calm.
b. Be flexible. Keep doors open for discussion, yet be
firm.
c. Do everything possible to be fair within the rules.
d. Announce results only when the situation is resolved.
e. Be willing to explain the infraction and the final ruling
to the media. Remain professional without reference to
personalities or the quotes of others.
f. Impress upon fellow officials and other meet
administrators to refrain from allowing personal
interpretations and emotions to inflame or prolong the
dispute.
- 3 -
STARTER/REFEREE
A. GENERAL REMINDERS:
1. Appearance: The starter should arrive at the meet in the
proper uniform, orange shirt/jacket and blue slacks/shorts. The
uniform should be clean and pressed. The PIAA patch should
be worn on the left shoulder, 3" down from the shoulder seam.
An American flag may be placed on the right sleeve in the
same position. An official’s appearance is very important in
promoting a professional presence. Often, at dual/tri meets
there is only one PIAA official assigned to a meet and that
makes you not only the starter but also the referee and field
judge. It is important to give the impression that you are
capable of handling the job at hand. First impressions count.
The physical condition of an official is equally important. Like it
or not, we are role models for the athletes and it does not
promote our sport if we are out of shape and find it difficult to
get from one event to the other in a timely fashion.
2. Equipment: Make sure your starting device is clean and in
good working order. Check your bag the night before to make
sure you have all your supplies. It is helpful to keep a box of
starter’s blanks in your bag, in the event that you would arrive
at the site and someone "forgot" to have starter’s blanks on
hand.
3. Be courteous. As the old saying goes, "You can catch more
flies with honey than with vinegar." No matter what problem or
situation occurs, always maintain a courteous approach.
4. Know the Rules. Passing your test or being an experienced
official does not exempt you from staying on top of the rules. It
is good practice to read through the rules book every season.
At smaller meets you may be the only official on site, and may
be required to answer questions about field events. Few if
any officials know every rule, but perception becomes reality
and you will be perceived as more competent, if you are
familiar with the rules book and can find answers quickly.
- 4 -
5. Preventative Officiating. Remember, we officiate so the
athletes can have a fair, positive experience. They gain
nothing by being disqualified for an improper uniform or
wearing a piece of jewelry. Through preventive officiating, we
may be able to correct a situation before it becomes a
problem.
B. PRE-MEET
1. Be on time. Allow ample time to arrive at the site. Minimally 30
minutes before the scheduled starting time.
2. Check the facility. Take a walk around the track, checking for
potential problems; line markings, holes, water laying on the
track, etc. Also, do a visual inspection of the jumping and
throwing areas. Safety for the athletes is a # 1 priority!
3. Greet all coaches and shake hands. Speak to them and
exchange pleasantries so they feel that you are approachable
in the event a situation occurs. Discuss with the "host site"
coach information about the facility and the staff working the
finish line.
4. Meet with the finish line staff. Get familiarized with the
procedure they use and be sure everyone understands how
the start of the race will proceed.
5. Meet with team captains and coaches. Confirm uniform rule
and read the Sportsmanship Message.
C. STARTING TECHNIQUES
1. Signal the Head Finish Judge that the race is about to begin.
When finish line returns an "all ready", competitors should be
asked to remove their warm-ups. Starter takes a position
outside of the track.
2. Races or opening relay legs of less than 800 meters - runners
usually start out of blocks:
- 5 -
a. Raise the starting device to the over-the-head position
and give the command, "ON YOUR MARKS." At the
same time swing the other arm (starting with elbow
straight and hand at side) backward and upward over
the head and then down in front, ending with hand
pointing to the ground in front. After a reasonable
length of time, sufficient to allow all runners to become
comfortable and motionless (if the starter feels the
time taken to prepare for the "set" command is too
long, he/she may direct the runners to stand and warn
the offender(s) to arrive at the pre-set position more
quickly).
b. Give the command "SET" and at the same time, raise
the free hand above the head. (Do not Yell. The SET
command should be given in clear and crisp voice, but
never yell at the runners). All runners should respond
immediately and assume their final set position. The
starter should fire the starting device only after all
runners are set and motionless. Runners can be called
up at this point, if the interval assuming final set
position is too long.
3. Individual races or relay legs of 800 meters or longer:
a. Runners are asked to take a position 3 meters behind
the starting line/starting arc.
b. With the starting device raised over the head and the
other hand pointing to the ground in front, give the
command "ON YOUR MARKS," and at the same time
quickly raise the free arm over the head.
c. When all are motionless, fire the starting device.
d. If a runner goes down in the first 100 meters, fire the
starting device again to recall the runners and restart
the race.
- 6 -
4. Starting violations that constitute a false start:
a. Failure to comply with the starter's commands.
b. Having any part of the body in contact with the
starting line or running surface beyond the line,
when the starting device is fired.
c. Failure to remain motionless after assuming the set
position prior to the starting device being fired.
d. Repeated use of disconcerting acts.
5. A starter should never "save" a runner from a false start by
shortening the time interval between the "SET" command
and the firing of the starting device. It is the responsibility
of the starter that all competitors receive a "FAIR AND
EQUAL START".

TIMERS AND FINISH JUDGES
The Finish System
The suspense and drama of the track competition are often
focused on the activities at the finish line. Here the effective
coordination of the various skills and abilities of the finish officials
becomes evident. Officials who determine the correct finish order
are complemented by other officials who assign times to each
competitor. These tasks are supervised by the Head Finish
Judge who makes the final decisions concerning the places of
each race.
At every meet, an official is to be designated as Head Timer. This
official must supervise the timing and recording of all times,
immediately check that any record performances are recorded
correctly, and maintain the orderly assignment of accurate times
to each competitor. In assigning timers, whenever possible, the
Head Timer should assign a timer to cover every place. However,
as a minimum for scoring meets, the Head Finish Judge shall
assign Lap Scorers (and a Special Lap Scorer), Finish Judges
and Timers to pick or time one more place than the number of
places to be scored.
Lap Scorers, Timers and Finish Judges should work as part of a
team, seeking accurate finish results for every finisher. Where
there are two or more competitors finishing closely, care should
be taken to record the position of each athlete in relation to each
other (i.e., inside, outside, middle of track). This is especially
important when close finishes are between those occupying the
inside and outside lanes.
- 11 -
Lap Scorers
Lap Scorers are assigned to keep track of the number of laps
completed by each competitor in races of 1500 meters or longer.
Each Lap Scorer should not be responsible for more than four
competitors. A Special Lap Scorer shall be appointed by the
Head Finish Judge to notify each competitor concerning the
number of laps she/he still has to complete. The Special Lap
Scorer (or her/his designee) shall indicate the final lap of the race for
each competitor by ringing a bell. The Special Lap Scorer shall call
out the order of finish to assist the Finish Judges and Timers
identifying assigned placers.
Timing
Timing Methods: Two methods of timing are considered official-hand
timing and fully automatic timing. A timing device which operates
automatically only at the start or finish is not acceptable for
producing official times. Hand times are taken using either
stopwatches or manually operated electronic devices.
When an approved digitally recording, video or photographic device
with fully automatic electrical timing (FAT) is used to record the
finish, the official photo or image is turned over to a Photo Finish
Panel for review and preparation of official results. A videotape
system may also be used to record the finish places and times if it
meets all of the technical requirements, which have been
established, and if it has been calibrated by an independent testing
laboratory. However, should the Referee determine that the fully
automatic timing equipment is not operating properly, then the hand
times shall be official. Typical examples of each system are the
computer finish line systems such as Omega or Finish Lynx, PyroBright Flash and Accutrac.
Taking and Recording Times: The competitor's time shall be taken
from the flash/smoke of the Starter's pistol or approved apparatus to
the moment at which any part of the competitor's torso (as
distinguished from the competitor's head, neck, arms, hands, legs or
feet) reaches the perpendicular plane of the nearer edge of the
- 12 -
finish line. When possible, there should be three official timers
assigned to time each scoring place and one or two alternative
timers who shall time the winner of each event. Ideally, every
competitor should receive an official time.
As illustrated below, if two of the Official timers' watches agree and
the third assigned to that place disagrees, then the time shown by
the two agreeing watches shall be the official time. If all three
watches disagree, the time shown by the watch recording the middle
time (not the average of all three) shall be the official time. If for any
reason only two watches record the competitor's time, and they fail
to agree, the longer time of the two shall be accepted as the official
time.
Watch #1 Watch #2 Watch #3 Official Time
10.7 10.7 10.8 10.7
10.3 10.5 10.6 10.5
10.3 10.4 N.T. 10.4
In all hand timed races on the track, the times shall be rounded to
the 1/10th of a second. The times for races partly or entirely
outside the stadium (e.g., cross country) shall be recorded to the
next longer full second (i.e., a cross country time of 19 minutes
44.3 seconds shall be recorded as 19:45). If a digital watch or a
manually operated electronic timer is used which records times to
the 1/100th of a second, all times not ending in zero in the second
decimal (1/100th of second) shall be rounded up to the next longer
1/1 0th of a second. For example:
Digital Time -- Official Time
1:44.21 = 1:44.3
1:44.20 = 1:44.2
1:44.29 = 1:44.3
Fully automatic timing for track races up to and including the
3200 meters shall be recorded to next longer 1/100th of a
second.
- 13 -
Any race run partly or entirely outside the stadium shall read to
the 1/100 of a second and recorded to the next longer whole
second.
Picking and Timing Techniques
Assignment: Finish line personnel are assigned to the tasks of
determining an order of finish and assigning finish times. In
carrying out these duties, the finish line official must always
stay alert, maintain a calm attitude, and never get flustered,
even during a difficult situation such as a blanket finish of
eight competitors. An effective finish line official must not only
have quick reactions, but also the ability to concentrate
without distraction on the order of finish and selecting the
correct competitor to time or pick.
Time and Pick by Place, Not by Lane: Finish Judges are
responsible for determining which competitor finished in a
specific finish place. Timers are responsible for timing a
specific finish place. Thus, Timers and Finish Judges are
assigned by the Head Finish Judge to time and pick a
competitor for a specific finish place and not to time or pick
competitors by lane! Because the middle of the finish pack
are the most difficult to distinguish, the Head Finish Judge
should assign her/his most experienced Timers and Finish
Judges to places 3 - 5. If a FAT system is being used and is
functioning properly, then places will be assigned from the
finish image. The Finish Judges places will be used as
backup.
Location: To properly observe the finish and to distinguish
between close finishers, all finish line personnel should stand
in an elevated position at least 5 meters back from, and in
line with the finish line. Both Timers and Finish Judges must
concentrate on the race. They are to follow the race from the
moment competitors are brought to the “set” (or “on your
marks”) position at the start line until their assigned placer’s
torso crosses the vertical plane of the finish line.
- 14 -
They should concentrate on the entire event well beyond the
finish line on order to accurately assist with the proper
recording of times and placers.
Proper Technique: Timers should become familiar with the
operation of the watch well before the start of competition.
The watch should be held face up in the palm of the hand
with the index finger on the start button. Concentrating on the
Starter's pistol, not the runners, the watch is started the
instant the flash or smoke is seen, not with the sound.
After starting the watch, the Timer must always check that
the watch is running properly. If for any reason, the watch did
not start or the time is suspected to be incorrect, the Timer
should immediately notify the Head Timer or Head Finish
Judge. Back up (alternate) Timers should be pre-assigned
and ready to cover such situations.
When the competitors are approximately 10 meters from the
finish, the Timers and Finish Judges should turn their
attention to the finish line so that they can effectively
distinguish the order of finish, giving particular attention to
close competitions between athletes on opposite sides of the
track. It is essential that the official's concentration is not
broken at the moment the assigned placer crosses the finish
line.
Since competitors may or may not have competition and/or
hip numbers, it is valuable in closely contested events (e.g.,
the sprints and hurdles) for the Timers and Finish Judges to
record the lane number of the placer and to visually follow
that placer down the track to identify distinguishing
characteristics such as uniform colors and physical attributes.
To avoid blocking the view of another finish line official, in
shorter races, Timers and Finish Judges should remain on
the finish stand until all competitors have crossed the finish
line before leaving their places and seeking the name and
number of an assigned competitor or conferring with other
officials assigned to the same finish place.
- 15 -
The times and places are then reported in consistent fashion
to the Head Finish Judge (e.g., first place, then second, then
third, etc.).
To assist the Timers and Finish Judges (in the event that Lap
Scorers are not assigned), the Head Finish Judge shall be
responsible for signaling the final lap for each competitor in
races of 1500 meters or greater and to call the order of the
finish. When qualifying heats are conducted for any race, the
Head Timer shall record all of the times in every heat. These
should be made available, if needed, in the event that the
fully automatic timing (FAT) device fails to operate in any of
the heats.
When an official serves in the dual capacity of Timer and
Finish Judge, the order in which the competitors finish is of
primary importance. In this situation, the official must track
the assigned placer beyond the finish line, distinguish the
placer by some identifying characteristic (before moving off
the finish stand), and gather the placer's identifying
information prior to reporting the placer's finish time.

WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A TRACK & FIELD UMPIRE
WHO ARE UMPIRES?
Umpires are assistants to the Referee assigned to report any rules
infringement. Their duty is to watch for breaches of rules; however,
they have no power to render any decisions. They stand or sit at
such points as the Referee or Head Umpire shall determine. Any
infractions or incidents observed should be reported to the Referee
or Head Umpire after indicating the occurrence of such by a yellow
flag or some other signal previously agreed upon. Otherwise, an
all-clear signal may be indicated.
From the time the Starter begins the race until the finish line
personnel determine the results, the umpires become the
subjective interpreters of the athlete's actions. Always alert, the
umpire must know the intent of the rules of competition and their
appropriate application to the situations. The umpire must be
observant for a wide variety of possible fouls or infractions. This is
an area where the rules books of various governing bodies have
slight differences so it is particularly important to go over the rules
just before the meet to make sure the appropriate call is made
according to the NFHS Track and Field Rules Book.
DUTIES OF UMPIRES
It is the duty of the umpire to observe the competition closely. But,
the umpire is not there to find fault or to call fouls but rather to
insure a fair competition. The umpires should report orally and in
writing all apparent violations of the rules to the chief umpire
without waiting for a protest. In so doing, they assume no
responsibility for disqualification - only the Referee can make a
disqualification.
Upon observing an alleged violation, speak to no one about the
possible violation. Write it up on a violation card, and be sure to
include the competitor's number, lane, color of jersey and any
- 17 -
other details that may allow proper identification of the correct
athlete. The most important item is the identification of the
athletes involved. Without this the Referee can do nothing.
The umpire shall raise a yellow flag, or signal in the agreed
manner, in the event of an alleged violation as soon as the
umpire's area is clear. Raise the flag until the Head Umpire or
Assistant acknowledges it. Do not waive it around.
ALL RACES
Competitors should not receive any assistance whatsoever during
the progress of an event. Assistance includes conveying advice or
information to an athlete. All rules books allow verbal
communication from outside the competition area provided that no
mechanical device is being used. Any athlete receiving such
assistance should be reported to the Head Umpire.
All infringements of the Rules should be reported on the Umpire's
Report Form. The number of any competitor dropping out of a race
and the lap number, where applicable, should be noted and
passed on to the Head Umpire. When an athlete commits a
flagrant foul in a race to aid a teammate, all persons from the
offending team in that race shall be disqualified. Such an infraction
would be reported by the umpire and ruled on by the Referee.
RUNNING WITHOUT ASSIGNED LANES
Observe runners during the race for illegal passing, crowding,
cutting in or jostling while within your area of responsibility. Jostling
or impeding or obstruction should be watched for especially when
athletes are not in lanes. This occurs frequently on the curves or
when competitors are cutting in.
A competitor may run anywhere on the track at any pace or any
change of pace as long as the competitor does not impede or
obstruct by any body or arm action the progress of another runner.
- 18 -
It is a violation if the runner veers to the right or left so as to
impede a challenging runner and forces the challenging runner to
run a greater distance.
A competitor may pass another runner legally on either the right or
left side. A competitor may cut in front of another runner, provided
that the overtaking runner has one full stride (this rule also applies
to the waterfall start).
Direct contact is not necessary; any action that causes another
runner to break stride or lose momentum can lead to
disqualification. NFHS Track & Field Rules require a full stride
(about 7 feet). This is the only rules book to specify a distance. It is
a violation if a competitor runs inside the track curb on a curve or
passes another by running inside of the track curb. Voluntarily
leaving the track, and presumably the race, then returns later to
continue the race should be reported.
Note. In general more interference is allowed at higher levels of
competition and on indoor tracks.
At some track meets, certain umpires may be asked to keep a
record of laps completed by all competitors in races longer that
1500 Meters. The lap scorer shall keep a record of the laps
completed of the designated competitor. They will notify each
competitor the number of laps, which are still to be completed,
and record it on a lap scoring form. One lap scorer will signal the
final lap for the race leader, usually by ringing a bell.
RACES THAT START IN LANES, BUT DO NOT FINISH IN LANES
In a race starting, but not finishing in lanes, the athlete must
cross the break line within the assigned lane. Until crossing the
break line the athlete must maintain the assigned lane in
accordance with the rules for races run entirely in lanes.
If steps on or over the inside lane are allowed by rule, the athlete
must make sure that they are in the proper lane before crossing
the break line. For example a high school athlete may step inside
- 19 -
the lane line for two steps, but must correct the third step before
the break line in the assigned lane. Small markers, cones or
flags, may be placed at the intersection of the lane lines and
break lines.
RACES RUN ENTIRELY IN LANES
In all races run in lanes, competitors shall start and finish within
their assigned lanes. The competitor may be disqualified if
observed to have deliberately run outside the assigned lane and
gained an advantage. Each rules book has a slightly different
definition of this foul particularly if it occurs on a straightaway, or
on a curve. Be sure you can report the number of steps taken
that are on or over the inside lane line. The Referee may also
want to know how far over the line the athlete was.
Note: If a runner runs outside the assigned lane in the
straightway or runs outside the outer line on the curve, with no
material advantage gained and no other runner obstructed, no
disqualification will take place.
RELAY RACES
The same rules and penalties with reference to fouling, illegal
assistance, or violations that apply to other running events shall
also apply to relay racing. The Umpire should ensure that baton
exchanges are made within the exchange zone. The position of
the baton, not the competitor’s hands or feet is the decisive
factor. The pass is completed only when the baton is in the hand
of the receiving runner.
If the baton is dropped, whoever drops it must pick it up. The
pass must still be completed in the exchange zone and the team
may not gain advantage or interfere with other runners while
retrieving the baton. Each competitor must carry the baton by
hand throughout his/her leg of the relay.
- 20 -
The following are other possible relay violations for which
Umpires should be alert:
1. Runners must stay in their lanes after passing the baton until
all other runners have passed.
2. In the 4 X 400 meter relay, runners are allowed to move to an
inner position for the second and third hand off. Watch for
unfair jostling and/or obstruction.
3. Assistance by pushing-off or by any other method should be
reported.
4. The baton is thrown not passed to the next runner.
5. While running, a team member transports the baton in some
manner other than in the hand.
6. The last runner of the team finishes the race without a baton.
7. After passing the baton, a runner veers out of the passing
lane or from a straight course and impedes an opposing
runner.
8. Assuming a preparatory position in any race run in lanes, any
part of the outgoing runner breaks the plane of the adjacent
lane lines so as to interfere with another runner.
9. The outgoing runner waiting for the baton does not take a
position entirely within the 20 meter passing zone.
10. A team member runs more than one leg.
11. After handing of baton, the incoming runner impedes another
runner other than another incoming runner who has already
handed off the baton.
In sprint relays, if the incoming leg is 200 meters or less, the
outgoing runner may use the international acceleration (fly)
zone. In high school, the incoming runner must be in an
assigned lane for the entire leg.
- 21 -
Check marks may be placed on the track for races run in
lanes, within their own lane. Material authorized by the games
committee should be used to mark the track as authorized by
NFHS rules.
Note: Umpires should make sure that all markings made by the
athletes are removed immediately after the race.
HURDLE RACES
All competitors must clear, within their lane, the required
number of hurdles. This must be done without running around
the side, trailing or leading the leg along side below the level
of the hurdle bar, intruding into another lane, deliberately
knocking down a hurdle with the hand or foot or impeding
another hurdle.
Umpires should observe the runners as they are coming,
clearing and going. On all hurdle races always be alert to the
proper settings (height and weight), placements and locations.
Usually, in major meets, a Hurdle Chief with the hurdle crew
will handle this chore. In those situations where someone has
the responsibility of placing and checking the hurdles, it is still
a good idea for umpires to double check to make sure that
everything is ready for the race.
UMPIRE POSITION
In many cases, there will not be enough umpires to staff every
position indicated. In those cases, the Head Umpire will need
to prioritize the positions. The first priority is the beginning and
ending of each turn. These should be designated for assistant
umpires if available. The next priority would be the positions
midway between the first four.
As additional umpires are available then positions may be
assigned to other positions either inside or outside the track.
- 22 -
For hurdle races, the Head Umpire should make sure that
every flight could be observed preferably by two umpires on
opposite sides of the track. This also applies to the
steeplechase.
During the relays, the Head Umpire should make sure that
there are enough umpires assigned to each zone without
losing the ability to judge lane violations. It works best if the
umpire does not have to watch more than two lanes in a big
meet. If there are not enough umpires for that, then fewer
umpires can be assigned to the entrance of the zone as most
violations are at the exit end of the zone.
Obviously those races less than one full lap require fewer
umpires. The Head Umpire should not overload the track just
because there are many umpires. For example, the 100 meter
dash does not need any more than twelve umpires and can
get by with fewer if necessary.
The Head Umpire may have to modify any locations due to
local conditions such as a wall next to the track.
REPORTING INFRACTIONS
To report a possible rule infraction, which could result in a
disqualification, the umpire must be able to clearly recall the
circumstances surrounding the infraction to aid the Referee in their
decision. For this reason, a written report of what was observed
should always be prepared as soon as possible. The Umpire
should always:
1. Carry rule violation cards or paper and. pencil to record the
information. A small notebook is often useful for this
purpose.
2. Use the violation report form provided by the Head
Umpire.
- 23 -
3. Signal the Head Umpire immediately by holding up a
yellow flag at the spot of the infraction. Do not wave the
flag, simply raise it.
4. Record the name of the event, heat number, time of day,
lane number, competitor(s) number(s), team affiliation,
uniform colors, and a brief description of the possible
violation.
The following form is an example of an Umpire Violation Report
Form. Different meets and games committees have different types
and styles of forms. The umpire should make every effort to fill out
the form as completely as possible, no matter how insignificant the
possible foul may seem. The Head Umpire should always come to
gather the report form and discuss what was observed.
The Referee has the final say, unless there is a Jury of Appeals,
and may or may not disqualify based on the full appraisal of the
complete situation. Do not get involved in a protest unless the
Referee summons you to clarify the report. The Referee and not
the Umpire disqualifies the athlete.
Once you turn in a violation report put it out of your mind, you have
nothing more to do with it. Do not be offended if your call is not
upheld. Even though you made the violation report you may not
know all the circumstances. It is your job to report what you see
and once you have the report completed your job is complete. Let
it go. Report what you saw and document it to the Meet Referee.
Only the Meet Referee can decide on intent, or make a decision on
the legality of what was reported. By reporting what you saw your
responsibilities as an umpire are complete. Do not get into a
debate with anyone regarding decisions by the Meet Referee.

PURPOSE OF THE OFFICIAL
1. To help athletes get their best performance in a safe and
equitable competition.
2. To be seen but not heard.
3. To know and apply the rules fairly and uniformly to all. So no
one has either an advantage or a disadvantage. Rules are to
help solve rather than cause problems.
4. To explain rules clearly and use common sense and tact in
applying them.
5. To maintain a safe competition for athletes, officials and fans
both during warm-ups and the competition. The needs of the
athletes must be considered first but you need to be in charge,
not the coach.
6. To not socialize during the competition with athletes, coaches
or other officials.
Safety:
Always be attentive when you are on the field (or track). Field
events can be dangerous if you are hit with any of the implements.
You can be killed or seriously injured. Do not cross runways or the
- 33 -
throwing sector during a competition. Always keep your eye on the
runway or the circle. Be prepared for the unexpected. Particular
attention must be paid during the warm-up period since the time
between throws is much shorter. Position yourself so the
implement will land to the side and in front of you. Remember
many of the implements tend to skip when they land so never be
directly behind them. Be attentive to the wind direction and
whether the thrower is left or right handed since both will impact
which way the implement will move in the air and after hitting the
ground.
Keep the competitors behind the front of the cage and at least 6
feet back from the cage or circle. Do not let anyone go into the
impact area except the field officials. Keep coaches, officials and
athletes away from the sector lines during the competition.
Return all implements to the side of the sector. They should not be
thrown. Make sure warm-ups are done in the cage. Once the
competition has been started, the competitors are not permitted to
use the circles, runways or areas within the sectors for practice.

- 36 -
OFFICIATING THE SHOT PUT
A. Preparation for the Competition
The Head Judge should report to the event site well in advance of the
competition. Initially inspect the site to determine that it is in
conformance with the rules of the event (sector lines, circle, stop
board, safety zones, etc.). Introduce yourself to assisting officials and
review their duties and responsibilities with them.
Once the event site is opened for warm-up throws, all officials must
supervise this activity. Care must be taken to ensure the safety of the
competitors, officials and spectators. Competitors should not be
permitted in the impact area during the warm-up period. Officials
should retrieve the implements and return them to the same side of the
sector that they will be returned to during the competition. Every effort
should be made to keep competitors out of the sector, or from coming
past the restraining line. Safety is of the utmost importance and cannot
be stressed enough.
Check-in of the competitors should begin no later than 20 minutes prior
to the start of the competition. The Head Judge can conduct the
check-in at the circle as he/she regulates warm-ups. This is also an
excellent time to do preventative officiating with regard to uniform and
taping violations. (Note - in the shot put, no taping of any part of the
hand or fingers is permitted unless there is an open wound that must
be protected by tape; taping of the wrist is permissible. Gloves are not
permitted; however competitors are permitted to wear support belts).
Implements must also be inspected for conformance to rules; in meets
where an inspector of implements has certified the implement, the
proper inspection marking should be visible. Competitors' numbers
should be verified if they are being used.
Prior to the start of competition, the Head Judge should meet with the
competitors to review the general rules for the event and group the
competitors into flights. Other points of emphasis may include:
- 37 -
1. Calling up of competitors - The Head Judge will call up each
competitor to begin his/her trial. This call includes the
competitor who is "up" (whose trial is now underway), the
competitor who is "on deck" (the next competitor to compete)
and the competitor who is "on hold" (the third in line to
compete).
2. Uniform rule modifications - No jewelry, including watches, is
permitted to be worn during competition. Other exclusions
include sunglasses (except prescription), hat/head coverings
(except religious) and bracelet/wristbands. Single color
"scrungies" not wider than 2" are permitted.
3. Use of adherents - Competitors are permitted to use chalk or
an adhesive or similar substance such as resin during
competition.
4. Excused from the event - Competitors must be informed that
they are to report to the Head Judge prior to leaving the event
site to compete in another event and also upon their return.
The time limit for competing in another event, as determined
by meet management, should also be communicated by the
head judge to the competitors.
B. Officiating Procedures
The Head Judge has primary responsibility for ruling on the legality of
the throw. He should watch the thrower in the circle first. If the throw is
fair in the circle, he then should watch for the implement to land. The
competitor cannot leave the circle until the implement has landed and
then they must do so under control from the back half of the circle.
The Head Judge should not yell, "Foul" during a throw, even if the foul
occurs at the very beginning of the throw. This could distract the
competitor and cause him to fall and possibly injure himself.
- 38 -
During the event, the Head Judge should not hesitate to move while a
competitor is in motion to get a better view of the circle and the
competitor. Positioning is critical in evaluating the trial, so be in an
advantageous position.
When measuring the throw, the measurement shall be recorded from
the nearest edge of the first mark made by the implement in the sector
to the inside edge of the stop board nearest the mark. The Assistant
Judge should pull the tape true and straight through the center of the
circle with some slight tension maintained during the measurement.
Measurements shall be recorded to the nearest ¼".
Assistant judges working in the sector are primarily responsible for
determining the first mark made by the implement and calling sector
line fouls.
In the shot put, the weight of the implement will create an indentation,
except in the hardest of ground. The judge(s) should be in position to
move to the mark quickly. The throw should be marked from the
nearest mark made by the implement inside the sector lines, not the
center of the impact area. The mark should be held until the head
judge has measured and recorded the throw.
The implement must clearly land within the sector lines to be a legal
throw. Judges should be in proper position to properly rule on whether
or not the throw is legal.
Assistant judges are also responsible for carrying the implements back
to the sector lines for retrieval by the competitors.
C. General Rules for the Shot Put
The shot is put from the shoulder with one hand only. At the time the
competitor takes a stance to commence a put, the shot shall touch or be
in close proximity to the chin and the hand shall not be dropped below
this position during the put attempt. The shot must not at any time be
brought below the line of the shoulders. In summary, the rules affecting
the shot put are:
- 39 -
1. After entering the circle, the competitor must start from a
stationary position.
2. The competitor must not leave the circle until the shot has
landed. The competitor must exit the back half of the circle
under control.
3. The shot must be held in close proximity to the neck or chin -
the throwing arm must not drop behind or below the shoulder
level.
4. During the put attempt, the competitor may touch the inner
face of the stop board or the iron band. The competitor is
prohibited from touching the top of the circle or the ground
outside the circle during the put.
5. The competitor may not touch the top or end of the stop board
before the put is marked.
6. Any part of the competitor's body may extend over the iron
band or stop board provided it does not touch the ground
outside the circle.
7. The shot must be put so that it falls clearly within the sector
lines.
8. The competitor must initiate put within 1 minute after being
called for a trial.
D. General Rules for the Competition
1. Each competitor shall be allowed three preliminary trials.
Competitors advancing to the finals are allowed three
additional trials (Note: in meets with limited entries, meet
management may allow all competitors just four trials).
2. When preliminaries are held, one or more competitors than
there are scoring places will qualify for the finals. All
competitors tying for the last position will advance to the finals.
- 40 -
If a competitor qualifying for the finals withdraws from the
competition, no substitute will replace the withdrawn
competitor (Note: to be eligible for the finals, a competitor must
have had one legal throw in the preliminaries).
3. Competition in the finals shall be in reverse order of
performance, in single rotation or more than one trial in
succession, so that the best qualifier will compete last.
4. During the competition, both preliminaries and finals, the Head
Judge may allow trials to be taken in succession in order to
accommodate a competitor who may be excused to participate
in another event.
5. To place in the event, a competitor shall have had at least one
legal throw.
6. Competitors will be credited with their best performance
regardless of whether it occurs in the preliminaries or finals.
7. To break ties for places, if the distance resulting from the best
performance of competitors is identical, the higher place will be
awarded to the competitor whose second-best throw is better
from either the preliminaries or the finals. Should the tie
remain, the higher place will be awarded to the competitor with
the third-best performance, etc.

OFFICIATING THE JAVELIN THROW
Applicable rules
NFHS rules apply as modified by the PIAA. Be sure you review all
applicable rules before you assume your assignment.
Officials and their duties
At an invitational, you probably will have enough help to conduct the
event properly. Minimally, you should have the following people to
successfully manage the event:
Head Judge – this is the person directly responsible for
running and managing the event.
Assistant Judges:
x One judge reads the tape and assists the Head Judge in
the management of the event.
x One judge pulls the tape through the point of the sector to
ensure that there is accurate measurement of the distance
thrown.
x One judge has the “0” end of the tape, usually attached to
a stick or cane, and marks the first point of contact that the
javelin has with the ground. He/she will hold this mark until
the tape has been read, the distance recorded, and the
reader and pull through judges have left the runway.
x In meets where there are enough judges to do so, a judge
serves as a flight coordinator to assist in the running of the
event. This judge usually is located at the back of the
runway (furthest from the toe board) and has a duplicate
list of competitors’ names in flights. They let each athlete
know the order of throwing (up, on deck, on hold), and
alert the Head Judge if there is any change in the throwing
order.
- 42 -
x The remaining judges assist in marking the landing of the
javelin and safely return the javelins to the designated area
for athletes to retrieve them.
NOTE: In most dual and tri-meets, where help may be at a
premium, the Head Judge is in charge and should be the
person at the toe board to adjudicate the fairness of all throws.
A competent person in the sector to mark the throw is also
necessary and should be an adult. The person to pull the tape
through could be a student worker, so long as they are able to
pull the tape through the point.
Additional persons/students to assist in the retrieval and return of the
javelins are helpful, as they will help to move the event along. Be sure
these people are alert and act responsibly.
Event setup
When setting up for the javelin throw, there is one overriding
concern for the event official – SAFETY!
In most cases, meet management will have already
determined the venue for the event. However, it is YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY AS THE REGISTERED OFFICIAL to make
certain that the venue is safe. When at all possible, keep the
venue clear of all other track and field event areas.
Inspect the venue for the following:
x Level, even run up for the throwers.
x Level, even landing area.
x No other events in close proximity to the landing area.
x If on grass, make sure the grass is not slippery or otherwise
hazardous. Many times the planting area will be chewed up or
muddy, especially late in the season.
x A controlled area where the competitors can wait.
x No overhead wires or other obstacles.
x Sector lines and foul lines are laid out correctly.
- 43 -
If you find the venue to be deficient in any of these areas, request that
meet management make any necessary corrections to make it safe for
competition. If they refuse or cannot make the necessary
accommodations, and the venue is unsafe IN YOUR OPINION, the
event should be forfeited and the points awarded to the visiting team.
At an invitational, this is usually not a problem since the venue will
have been used before.
Make sure that you have an area for the athletes to warm up in, and a
holding area for the active flight (when using more than one flight).
EVENT MANAGEMENT
Athlete check-in
Each athlete in the javelin must check-in with you BEFORE they
begin to warm-up for the event. They must be properly uniformed,
and their javelin should have either been inspected, or should be in
compliance with the rules. If the meet is using numbers, they
should have their number on when they appear before you.
Flights
If you have more than 12 competitors, you should break the group
of throwers into flights. With fewer than 12, you can run them as
one flight. In championship meets, the top 7-9 throwers will
advance to the finals for 3 more attempts.
In dual and tri-meets, you can use the trials/finals format, or you
can use 4 attempts in lieu of that.
Warm-up periods
Most injuries in the javelin occur during the warm-up period. If
there is adequate help, such as at an invitational or other
championship meet, regulate the warm-ups on the runway. The
retrievers in the landing area should be the only persons in the
landing area and should always carry the implements back to the
designated area. Never throw them back.
- 44 -
In dual and tri-meets, where help may be limited, possibly can use
the following procedure:
1) After establishing flights, have each thrower take one throw,
in the order they will be throwing in, and then stand off to the
side of the runway.
2) When all throwers have taken their 1st warm-up throw, allow
them to go out into the sector and retrieve their implement.
They must carry them back to the runway, not throw them
back.
3) Take another throw in the same order, repeating the same
process as above, until all of the contestants are ready to
begin the competition.
4) This same procedure should be used for each flight.
5) Remember that the general rule in all throwing events is to
NEVER TURN YOUR BACK TO THE THROWER.
Safety concerns
It is most important that javelins always be carried and not thrown,
other than in the act of throwing them in competition. As noted
above, most injuries occur during the warm-up period due to
reckless and unsupervised behaviors. Another instance when
injuries occur is when throwers are warming up and making short
“spike” throws. These are short throws of only 5-10 feet when the
athletes will drive the javelin in the ground in front of them. These
should be limited to being done on the runway, and not in any
other area.
Recording distances
Be sure that the “0” end of the tape is in the landing sector. Usually
you will want to attach this to a stick or cane to make marking the
point of landing easier. The person working the “dead” end of the
tape should mark the spot where the javelin lands and hold that spot
until the Head Judge and the assistant pulling the tape leave the
runway.
- 45 -
Record the distance on the score sheet clearly. It is a good idea to
read the distance and then repeat it aloud so that you are sure of
what you read, and so that those watching the event can hear the
distance.
At meets where possible, have a second recorder to record the
distances. In this way, if there is a discrepancy, a back-up record of
what was measured and read will be helpful.
POINTS OF EMPHASIS
Safety, safety, safety! There is no more important aspect of the
javelin throw than maintaining safety in the throwing area.
Remember these important points:
1. Javelins should always be carried back to the runway,
never thrown back.
2. Warm-up periods should be regulated and monitored
closely by an official to ensure safety.
3. Never let anyone other than the sector judges into the
sector.
4. Keep the venue clear of all other events whenever
possible.
A well-managed event will be a well-run event. A well-run event
will benefit the athletes, the coaches and the spectators. You, as
the event judge, must take and maintain control of the event from
the time you begin warm-ups to the time the event is over and all
of the implements have been put away.
- 46 –
HIGH JUMP
Pre-Event Preparation
1. Read the current NFHS Track and Field Rules Book and Case
Book for the event.
2. Arrive at the site no later than 30 minutes before warm-ups.
3. Check the site for safety violations.
4. Determine that neither the pit nor the crossbar is touching the
uprights.
5. Determine that the pit is not breaking the plane of the
crossbar.
6. Mark the location of the uprights so they can be returned to
their original position if they are moved during the competition.
7. Mark the crossbar to determine that the same side is facing
toward the pit at all times.
8. Have all necessary equipment (pencils, clipboard, highlighter,
measuring device with English and Metric increments).
Warm-Up
1. Check in competitors.
2. Check competitors’ numbers if applicable.
3. Check competitors for compliance with the uniform and jewelry
rule.
4. Explain the jumping procedure to the competitors.
a. Jumping in flights as determined by the Head Judge.
b. Using the “five alive” procedure.
- 47 –
Officiating
1 Head Judge serves as flight coordinator, recorder, call
competitors up and measures heights.
2. Two assistant judges replace the crossbar, raise standards
as needed, keep the pit aligned with crossbar, watch for
feet breaking the plane of the crossbar, and time
competitors if needed.
3. Additional assistants may serve as a recorder of jumps
and serve as a timer.
4. Having a marshal available to police the area will help as
well.
- 48 -
POLE VAULT
The following guidelines are written to address three types of
competition: regular season dual meets, large meets, and
championship meets like the PIAA Championships.
A. Dual Meets
1. The host team coach or athletic director should have the
rules for the pole vault taped to the pole vault clipboard, as
the Head Judge is usually a teacher.
2. The Referee and/or Head Field Judge should be at the
field, if possible, 1 hour or more before the event is to start
to do the following:
a. Check the pit, standards, crossbar and vaulting area
for any safety violations.
b. Get the “PIAA Pole Vault Verification Form” from the
teams’ coaches or vaulters.
c. Check the vaulters’ pole weights so they are equal to
or greater than the vaulters’ weights. The weight of
the pole must be on the pole and it must include the
manufacturer’s handhold band. Layers of tape that
are uniform thickness may be on the pole.
3. Pole vault judge procedures
a. Write the vaulter’s name, weight and pole weight on
the scorecard.
b. Supervise the warm-up period.
c. Start the event after the final call is made by the
announcer. Write any passes for the first height or
subsequent heights.
- 49 -
d. Call the first three vaulters, such as A, B and C.
After A vaults, call the next three vaulters B, C and
D, etc. You can go down the list in a dual meet.
e. After the event, write the winning places names,
heights and points on the scorecard and the time
the event was completed. Sign the scorecard and
take to the scorer. Close the pole vault area.

1 Head Judge – scorecard and watch (usually a
teacher)
2 Student
3 Student – in charge of putting up the crossbar,
moving the standards from 18” to 31½” toward the
pit, and catching the poles.
B. Large Meets
1, The Head Judge and assistants should be at the field
1 hour or more before the event starts to do the
following:
a. Check the pit, standards, crossbar and vaulting
area for any safety violations.
b. Get the “PIAA Pole Vault Verification Form” from
the coaches or vaulters.
- 50 -
c. Check the vaulters’ pole weights so they are equal
to or greater than the vaulters’ weights. The
weight of the pole must be on the pole and it must
include the manufacturers hand hold band (newer
poles) or the weight written on the pole with a
hand hold band taped 6 inches from the top (older
poles). Uniform thickness layers of tape may be
on the pole.
d. Check the correct pronunciations of the vaulters’
names and write phonetically on the scorecard, if
necessary.
e. Supervise the warm-up period.
f. Start the event after the announcer makes the final
call. Write any passes for the first height.
g. Explain to the vaulters how the event will be run.
Usually at large meets the five-alive method works
best until less than ten vaulters remain, at which
time just proceed down the remaining list.
h. On the scorecard, mark an (x) for a failed attempt,
an (o) for a successful attempt and a (-) for a
passed attempt. When a vaulter has three failed
attempts in a row regardless of the height or
heights, draw a line from the last (x) to the right on
the scorecard, so one can easily see the vaulters
who are left in the competition.
i. A pole vault competitor(s) who has passed three
(3) consecutive heights and has NOT entered the
competition should be permitted two (2) minutes
of warm-up jumps per the number of competitors
entering at that height without the crossbar in
place. The competitor(s) shall enter the
competition at that height. Such warm-up must be
taken at a height change. (Example: if three (3)
competitors are entering the competition at 12’ 6”
- 51 –
the 3 vaulters will have a total of 6 minutes to
warm-up)
The Head Judge should notify the vaulter when 30
seconds remain if they have not initiated their trial.
j. After the event is completed, close the vaulting
area. Check and double check the winning
places. Write the names of the vaulters placing
and their heights on the scorecard. Sign the
scorecard and write the time the event was
completed and give to the Head Field Judge to
verify the results. Also give the Head Field Judge
the “Pole Vault Verification Forms”.

C. Championship Meets (such as PIAA Championships)
1. The Head Judge and Assistant Judge will be in the
 locker room to weigh the first vaulting class. Each
 vaulter must be in his/her track uniform and have
 the “PIAA Pole Vault Verification Form.” A judge
 will write the vaulter’s weight on the verification
 form and on the two scorecards for each class.
- 52 -
2. Other assistant judges will be at the pole-vaulting
area to write the weights of the poles on the forms
sent out from the locker room after they have
inspected the poles and verified the weights the
vaulters may use.
3. The Referee, with the help of the Head Judge,
must determine the runway to be used for the
safety of the vaulters. When the pit is set, the
standards are zeroed and the height of the
crossbar is measured. The Head Judge may then
open the runway for warm-ups, which should be
supervised by the assistant judges.
4. While the vaulters are warming-up, the Head
Judge will check with the vaulters the
pronunciations of their names and write
phonetically on the scorecard, inform the vaulters
of the starting height and write down any given
passes of heights.
5. The Head Judge will meet with vaulters after the
final call for the pole vault is given. He/she will
discuss with them the procedures to be used in
running the event and particularly, the possible
eight place finishers to stay around the pole vault
area to be escorted over for their award. Then
read the names of vaulters in the order of vaulting
and take any passes of heights, which he/she did
not receive prior to this time.

Assignments of #’s 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 may be rotated
throughout the competition.
Officiating Procedure
1. To start the competition, the Head Judge (#1) stands on
the runway facing the flight coordinator (#8) and reads the
first three vaulters in order of vaulting. The flight
coordinator (#8) will get the first vaulter on the runway,
check the pole weight according to the scorecard and get
the standard setting and relay to the Head Judge (#1) who
relays the standard setting to 4 and 5 who set the
standards. Crossbar setters (#6 and #7) will set the
crossbar at the correct height. When the standards and
crossbar are set, the Head Judge (#1) will step off the
runway, which is the signal for the vaulter that the 1
minute time clock will be started. The Head Judge (#1) will
announce to the vaulter when 30 seconds are left if the
trial has not been started. The Head Judge (#1) will
determine if a vault is a failed or successful vault. The
above procedure will be followed throughout the
competition.
2. At the conclusion of the competition for the first class, the
Head Judge (#1) will check and double check the results,
sign the scorecard and write the time of completion on the
card. Give the scorecard to the Head Field Judge to check
results and sign the card. The Head Judge (#1) will then
take the card to the Scorer at the tent and the eight place
winners and/or ties to the tent to receive awards.
- 54 -
3. The aforementioned procedures will be carried out for all
classes of vaulters.
National Federation Track and Field Rules relevant to pole vault
safety:
1 The competitor's weight shall be at or below the
manufacturer's pole rating. The manufacturers must include
on each pole: the pole rating that shall be a minimum of ¾
inch in a contrasting color located within or above the top
hand-hold position; a 1-inch circular band indicating the
maximum top hand-hold position with the position being
determined by the manufacturer.
2 A competitor shall not use a variable weight pole, a pole,
which is improperly marked, or a pole rated below his/her
weight during warm-up or competition. Penalty:
Disqualification from the event.
3 Prior to warm-up, the Field Referee, Head Field Judge, or
Inspector of Implements shall inspect each pole to be used in
the competition to verify that the poles are legal equipment as
per NFHS Track & Field Rules Book. This includes checking
the placement of a top hand-hold band, numerical pole ratings
a minimum of ¾-inches in a contrasting color located within or
above the top hand-hold band, and the proper binding layers
of adhesive tape are of uniform thickness. The binding shall
not be on or above the top handhold band.
4 It is the responsibility of the coach to verify the competitor will
use a legal pole rated at or above his/her weight.
5 It is a foul if the competitor grips the pole above the top handhold band. Penalty: An unsuccessful trial is charged, but
not measured.

PENNSYLVANIA INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION, INC. (PIAA)
POLE VAULT VERIFICATION FORM
ALL MEMBER SCHOOLS are required to process the PIAA Pole
Vault Verification Form listing the name and grade of each contestant
participating in the pole vault event. The head coach must verify, on
the day of each meet, the weight of each contestant, and the proper
ratings of all poles used by each contestant. This procedure is
required for indoor (winter) and outdoor (spring) track and field
competition. The completed form must be presented to the MEET
REFEREE/STARTER or HEAD FIELD JUDGE prior to the start of
warm-ups, on the day of competition.

OFFICIATING THE HORIZONTAL JUMPS
A good official must be knowledgeable in the rules and must be able to
apply them fairly. Safety for all must be the highest consideration. This
should include consideration of the impact of the event on surrounding
events and vice versa. Fair play is the second most important job of
the official. If a judge has any doubt about an attempt, the
competitor must be given the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes a
Judge should ask themselves "what is the spirit and intent of the rule?"
in order to give a fair and proper decision.
PRE-EVENT PREPARATION
1. Read the current NFHS Track & Field Rules Book and Case Book
for the event you are scheduled to officiate. Do not be afraid to use
the rules book to clarify situations.
2. Report to the site 60 minutes before the athletes arrive for warmups.
3. Contact meet management, to see if there are any special
instructions or rules for the day (examples may include how many
trials will be allowed, how many advance to the finals or if the
games committee approved any exceptions to the rules) and to
obtain the event scoring sheets.
4. Check the venue and surrounding area for any safety issues.
A. Inspect the runway for holes, indentations, etc., which could
cause injury to the athlete.
B. Check the length of the runway to be sure that it is long
enough (min. 130’).
C. Inspect the take-off boards. Boards should be a minimum of
8” wide.
- 57 -
1. If boards are inserted into the runway, they should
be shimmed so that they are level with the runway.
Use shims as wedges to assure that the board is
tight and will not move during take-off.
2. If a painted scratch line is used in instead of a
takeoff board, the front edge of the painted line
must have a straight edge so that jumps can
accurately be measured. Use white duct tape or
athletic tape to provide a straight edge if the
painted line is unsuitable.
D. Measure the distance to the pit from all take-off boards to
see if they are appropriate for the competition.
E. Inspect the landing area.
1. Check the length and width of the pit to see if it
meets specifications.
2. Inspect the surrounding edges of the pit for safety
(landing areas can be enclosed with concrete,
wood, artificial surfaces, or earth).
3. Check to see if the sand in the landing area has
been turned over. Be sure the landing area is soft
enough to allow for safe competition and that the
sand is the same elevation as the take-off board
and runway.
4. Extend a tape (at least a 150’ tape) from each
take-off to the end of the runway to assist the
athletes in establishing their marks.
WARM-UP PROCEDURE
1. Check in each competitor as they report to the site. Contestants
who have not checked in before the start of competition will not be
allowed to compete.
- 58 -
A. Check competitor number - if applicable. Numbers should be
displayed on the front of the uniform. Ask if they are
participating in an event that will conflict with this event.
Make note of the event on the event sheet.
B. If more than one take-off board is being used, ask the
competitor to identify the one he wishes to use. Mark the
board choice by his name on the event sheet.
C. Inform competitors of the uniform and jewelry rules as per
the PIAA Rule Modifications/Adoptions approved by the
PIAA Board of Directors (July 2014).
D. Inform the competitor of warm-up procedures and when the
runway will be closed.
1. In meets with more than one flight a 30-minute general
warm-up is given to all competitors.
2. All competitors not in the first flight are removed from the
runway at the end of this 30-minute period and the first
flight will be given 10 minutes to complete their warmups before competition begins.
3. Competitor not in the first flight will be given a 10-minute
warm-up before their flight begins.
4. All competitors in finals will be given a 10-minute warmup before finals begin.
F. Explain what is acceptable material to use for marks.
1. Chalk is not acceptable!
2. One or two markers (number and material as approved
by meet management).
3. No marker may be placed on the runway.
4. Markers may not be placed beyond the takeoff line
except by meet management.
- 59 -
F. During warm-ups, an official, or someone designated by
meet management should fill any holes in the landing area
caused by warm-ups. This is to prevent athletes from injury
caused by stepping into a hole while running through the pit.
G. Warm-ups should conclude 5 minutes before the designated
starting time to allow the landing area to be leveled for
competition. The pre-event meeting should be held at this
time.
INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPETITORS
While the landing area is being prepared for competition, an official
should meet with all competitors to inform them of the procedures used
in conducting the competition.
A. The procedure for determining how the competition will be
conducted is determined by meet management.
1. Competitors may be given four attempts. All attempts
count and there will be no finals.
Or
2. Each competitor will receive three preliminary trials to
qualify for finals. The number of finalists is determined
by taking one more competitor than the number of
scoring places. If two athletes tie for the last qualifying
position, both athletes will advance to finals. Finals will
be conducted in reverse order with each competitor
receiving three more attempts. All six trials will count
and the athlete will be credited with his best
performance.
3. Attempts will be taken in the jumping order determined
by meet management.
B. Inform competitors of the procedure used for participating in
another event.
- 60 -
1. Check out with the Head Judge before leaving event
(record checkout time).
2. Tell the competitor amount of time they will be given to
return (set by meet management).
3. The competitor can, with the permission of the Head
Judge, take attempts out of order, or all in succession.
4. If preliminaries are used, all jumps MUST be completed
by the ending time set by meet management.
5. Check back in with the official when returning (record
returning time).
C. The following commands will be used:
UP – competitor on the runway ready to jump.
ON DECK – warm-ups removed ready to be on the
runway when called UP.
ON HOLD – competitor should be ready to remove
warm-ups to be ON DECK.
D. The competitor has one minute to initiate a trial. Failure to
initiate a trial during the prescribed time will result in a foul.
The time begins when the athlete is called UP.
E. The jump will not be marked until the athlete properly exits
the landing area. This exit should be made ahead of the
mark in the landing area.
F. The runway or landing area may not be used for warm-ups
during competition.
- 61 -
G. Announce the jumping order to the competitors. Physically
line them up in jumping order on the runway so the
competitors can see who precedes them in the jumping
order. This should be done before each flight and before
finals.
JUDGING THE EVENT
The take-off shall be from the take-off board, the edge of which
nearer to the landing area shall be called the "scratch line" or “foul
line”. If a competitor takes off before reaching the board, it shall not
be counted as a failure. No marks shall be placed on the runway,
but a competitor may place marks alongside the runway as
specified by the NFHS Track and Field Rules Book. No marks may
be placed between the take-off board and the landing. Usually
athletic tape is used unless meet management provides markers.
CHALK IS NOT ALLOWED!!!
IT IS A FOUL IF THE COMPETITOR:
a. Allows his/her shoe to extend over the scratch line or make a
mark in front of it on the takeoff.
b. Runs across the scratch line, or scratch line extended.
c. In the long jump, does not keep his/her head in the superior
position, i.e., no somersault.
d. In the triple jump, if hopping does not land on the same foot
used in takeoff, or in stepping does not land on the other foot
from which the jump is performed.
(Example of a CORRECT sequence: Take-off left foot, then
left foot, then right foot (see graphic on next page.)
e. Fails to initiate a trial within 60 seconds after being called.
f. In the process of landing or leaving the pit, touches the ground
outside the landing nearer the scratch line than the nearest
mark made in the landing pit.
- 62 -
Before the competition begins, he/she should have been informed of
the jumping order, number of flights, and the number of competitors
that will qualify for finals, as well as any other rules or pertinent
information deemed necessary by the Head Judge.
When the competition begins, the competitors will be called up in the
jumping order by the flight coordinator (assistant judge). The flight
coordinator will check that each competitor is wearing the correct
number front and back, as issued and not mutilated or folded in any
way. When an athlete is called to jump, the next two athletes should
be called ON DECK and ON HOLD so that they may complete their
preparations and are ready to jump when called. From the moment
they are called (not from when they remove their warm-ups) each
athlete has one minute to initiate a jump that is carried to competition.
If only three judges are available to judge the event, the flight
coordinator could be dispensed with and those duties done by the
judge at the take-off board. If a competitor has started his trial before
the time limit expires, then the trial should be allowed unless otherwise
fouled. Once a competitor has been called up, they cannot change
their mind and decide to pass the trial. If they do, the attempt will
- 63 -
be recorded as a foul once the time interval has elapsed. Competitors
may pass an attempt any time up to when they are called up. The flight
coordinator should communicate any passes or changes in jumping
order to the Head Judge.
If a competitor experiences any interference during a trial, the Head
Judge may award the athlete a substitute trial. (Other competitors,
officials, or spectators, who cross as the athlete is making a trial, or a
photographer taking a flash photograph, are examples of interference,
which may occur).
TAKE-OFF BOARD
The Head Judge shall raise a white flag to indicate the validity of a trial
when notified by the Pit Judge that the competitor has correctly
exited the pit. When a foul occurs, the red flag is raised after the
athlete has completed his landing. The judge should hold the flag up
long enough so that the competitor, spectators, coaches, and officials
have a chance to see it.
MARKING THE JUMP
Once a competitor has jumped, the pit judge is responsible for deciding
if the athlete has correctly exited the pit. The judge should note that the
athlete leaves the pit in forward motion, ahead of his/her mark. It shall
be recorded as a foul if, after landing, the athlete walks back through
the pit, leaving the pit behind the mark in the landing area. Effectively
the athlete is making a mark nearer to the scratch line with each step
taken.
It is important that the official realize when a jump is complete. It is
generally accepted that once an athlete has correctly exited the
landing area the jump is complete and is then marked, measured, and
recorded. After giving the Head Judge the appropriate signal (fair or
foul), the Pit Judge will move into the pit and mark the jump.
If an athlete makes more than one impression in the sand and the Pit
Judge has difficulty deciding which mark is nearer to the foul line,
he/she should tell the judge at the board that they would like more than
- 64 -
one measurement taken. It can be deceptive, when marks are far
apart, as to which is closest to the foul line. A request to take two (2)
should be made by the Pit Judge and both marks should be measured.
Only the shorter distance should be announced and recorded.
It is also important that the Pit Judge be extremely careful when
observing and marking the jump. He/she should know where the
“zero” spot is located on the marking device, and that the marking
device is inserted as perpendicular as possible to the pit.
Since the distance is measured to the lesser ¼ inch, it is possible to
change distance if the procedure used to mark the jump is faulty.
MEASURING THE JUMP
The measurement of the jump shall be made at right angles from the
nearest break in the sand, inside the landing area, made by any part of
the body or apparel of the competitor to the take-off line or the take-off
line extended. The distance shall be measured to the nearest lesser
¼” below the distance covered, i.e. fractions less than ¼” are ignored.
If calibrated measuring equipment is used its accuracy must be
checked with a steel or fiberglass tape; otherwise a steel or fiberglass
tape should be used and the part of the tape showing the distance
jumped must be held at the take-off line. Alternatively, a scientific
apparatus that has a certificate of accuracy from a nationally
recognized standardizing organization may be used.
When the jump is measured, the judges should insure that the tape is
absolutely straight between the zero point and the reading point at the
foul line OR foul line extended. Judges should wait until the Pit Judge
has completed marking the jump in the sand before pulling the tape.
The tape should not be pulled so strongly that the reading may be
affected. It is helpful to use the runway lines as a guide to assist in
aligning the tape. The position of the tape puller should be about three
feet behind the take-off board.
The Pit Judge is responsible for supervising the leveling of the sand in
the pit. After the jump has been marked, the assistant judges can
--65 -
begin grooming the pit, from the back toward the takeoff board, so that
only the competitor’s mark remains to be smoothed after the Pit Judge
exits the pit. If a record is thought to have been established, the
athlete’s entire mark MUST NOT BE DISTURBED!
There is a tendency to demean the job of leveling the pit, assuming
that it is a minor position. It is so critical that the result of the
competition could depend on the quality of the leveling. Distance can
be gained or lost by sloppy raking. It is important to remember that the
competition can be decided on a distance of ¼”!
It cannot be stressed too strongly that all duties are of equal
importance and each have their part to play in providing an efficient
and well run competition. Where possible, particularly at major meets,
it is important to use experienced officials. When the pit is ready for
competition, the Pit Judge signals the appropriate official that
competition may resume.
The result of each jump should be recorded for a valid jump and with
the letter F for a foul jump. The official who is recording the results
should be aware of the records for the event so that the appropriate
actions can be taken to certify the record.
SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
1. The take-off board must be flush with the ground and firmly fixed.
2. The sand in the pit must be well dug and loosened before use.
Keep all implements well away from the landing area and, in
particular, never leave a rake with the prongs facing upwards.
3. Always be aware of any traffic from those who may need to cross
the runway.
4. All non-competitors must be cleared away from the competition
area -- no coaches, parents, etc.
5. Competitors should not use cassette recorders, radios, or similar
devices on the field.
- 66 -
6. In the triple jump, competitors may have a choice of take-off
boards to suit their performance level. The rules book makes
recommendations as to the distances that should be used;
however, these distances are determined by the caliber of the
competition. It may be necessary to improvise and make a
temporary board with white tape if athletes cannot reach the pit
from the shortest board.

7. The Field Referee or Head Field Judge should make the decision
regarding the number and distance of take-off boards. If more
than one board is used, the competitor’s board choice should be
indicated by his/her name on the card so the judge can be
positioned by the appropriate board.
