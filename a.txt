 Rotational Shot Put Technique The rotational shot put is divided into four main components; the start, the movement across the ring, the power position, and the delivery. Starting Position The thrower faces the back of the circle with the feet shoulder width apart, and the knees bent. The upper body will have some forward tilt, similar to the position in a back squat. Both arms are elevated overhead in the starting position; then, the shot is placed above the right shoulder. The wrist is bent facing upward, with the shot resting on the base of the fingers. The shot is then lowered onto the neck and placed near the ear with the elbow out. The left arm is extended out, in line with the center of the chest. There are different types of shot put placement positions between throwers; typically, for the rotational shot put, the ball is under the ear; some throwers hold it closer to the chin, like most gliders, but it is more common for the ball to be placed further back on the neck with the rotational technique. Coaching Note: ball placement in the rotational shot put is different than the glide shot put. With the glide technique, the shot is placed near the chin with the elbow down to help keep the ball in a linear path during the movement. The wind up id started with the upper body rotating toward the right side, the change in weight distribution should be controlled during the wind up to develop consistency in the technique. The rhythm pattern of the throw is established during the wind up. The thrower should focus on rotating the upper body with minimal weight shift of the lower body. The rotational shot put requires very little wind up when compared to the discus throw. The wind up can cause problems with balance and consistency; therefore, a static start or a minimal wind up is recommended for novice throwers in the rotational shot put technique. Coaching Note: the throwers can take static start throws without a wind up to reduce movement and eliminate the chance of starting the throw off balance. Static start throws can be a good warm up before more dynamic starts in the rotational shot put. Rotational Movement The body weight is shifted to the left leg and dropping the knee down over the toe, then the right leg is picked up to start the momentum building phase of the throw. When the left foot reaches 90 degrees, the right leg is lifted up from the hip and knee. After the right foot is off the ground, the right side sweeps across the body, the knee and inside of the foot will lead the lower body. A long, high sweeping action of the right leg around the outer edge of the circle will create a greater distance between the left foot and right toe during the sweep in the back of the circle, which will result in greater rotary momentum. The left knee should be angled downward with the knee over the pushed over the toe during the sweeping movement. The upper body should remain level and passive with the left arm inside the left knee to maintain balance and create separation during the sweeping action in the back of the circle. Drive to The Middle After the right leg sweeps around the outside of the circle, the right foot drives across the ring into the middle of the circle. The right leg penetrates the ring with a powerful drive upward as it accelerates forward. Coaching Note: one common style is to drive the inside of the right foot to the middle, like a soccer kick; this will help the thrower drive forward and reduce over rotating past the middle of the ring. The left leg should stay down with the knee bent, ready to push off toward the front of the circle as the right legs move toward the front of the circle. The shoulders should remain level during the drive to the middle; the shot stays behind the right hip, and the left arm extended left arm while remaining inside the left knee. Coaching Note: the thrower should think 'push off' with the left leg when the right leg starts to go forward after sweeping around the back of the circle. Power Position Set Up As the right leg moves past the middle of the ring, the right hip and foot should be pre-turned to set up the landing position. The left leg actively pushes off out of the back of the circle; the thrower will bring the knees together in the middle of the circle to help develop more velocity and create more torque in the power position. The shot remains behind the hip as the right foot touches down past the middle of the circle. The shot can rise up slightly into the middle of the circle, similar to the high point in the discus, just not an extreme. The left arm will drop down into the middle of the circle, slowing down the upper body creating additional separation from the lower body. Into the Power Position The right foot will contact the center of the circle between 280 to 340 degrees, while the left foot is airborne near 90 degrees. Once the right foot has made contact, it must continue to rotate, turning on the ball of the foot. The left leg should be aggressively planted in the front of the circle. The shot should remain behind the right foot, and the left arm should stay down until the left foot touches in the front of the ring. Once the left foot touches down, the main acceleration phase of the throw begins. The largest gains in implement velocity occur after the thrower reaches the power position. Even in single support (one foot on the ground), the right side should keep turning; when the left foot plants, the right foot should be approximately 90 degrees. The acceleration of the shot and body movements during the preparation phase and momentum building phase set up an active throwing position to effectively apply force into the shot during the delivery of the throw. Power Position Movement The thrower actively turns and lifts the right side into the left side of the lower body to create a blocking action. The right side lifts and turns toward the front of the circle while the thrower keeps the shot behind the hip. The left arm opens up to the center of the sector to set up the final blocking action of the left side during the release. Most of the bodyweight should stay centered during the lifting and turning action prior to the release. Coaching Note: the thrower will have some weight shift forward from the power position into the release. The thrower must keep the weight back over the right side as long as possible during the lifting action before the delivery phase. The power position base is narrower in the rotational shot put. The same heel-to-toe relationship as in the glide shot put technique is required to allow the hips to open up during the delivery phase.Delivery The right side of the body extends upward to complete the throw as the left side blocks. The thrower explosively lifts off the ground, the horizontal momentum created by driving across the ring is now converted into vertical velocity. The put is completed by lifting the shot upward then out over the toeboard; during the arm strike, the elbow is high, and the thumb is down. The left arm is pulled in toward the shoulder as the chest is driven up during the blocking action. The vertical lift increases the height of release and sets up the recovery action after the release. After the put is completed, the thrower will perform a reverse, bringing the right foot forward to the front of the ring after the shot is released. The right foot is planted flat and parallel throwing area; then the thrower can rotate around the right foot or execute other movements to stay in the ring. Corrective actions such as lowering the center of gravity or guiding the body away from the throwing sector can redirect the thrower's momentum to assist with recovery after the release of the shot.




Simple Keys to the Rotational Technique Wondering what you can do for a simple fix to any issues in your spin? Have a couple of technical breakdowns within the shot put rotational technique that you are confused by? You are struggling to find that groove and fix your technical errors? Check out the simple keys we focus on to keep the technique simple! Basics Before we dive into the keys around the rotational technique, let’s cover some very basic ideas and concepts that will enhance your comprehension of the shot put. For the purpose of this article, we will be referring to all parts of the body as though we are discussing a right-handed thrower. If you are coaching a left-handed thrower or you are a left-handed thrower, just flip the side of the body we are referring to. The basic technical concept we focus on is based around a rotational movement with a grounded finish. Try to change the mindset and method that you use to think of the spin. Start to view and understand the spin as a side around side movement. In simple terms, the right leg will rotate around the left side out of the back, the left side will rotate around the right side in the middle and the right side will rotate around the left side on the finish! When this simple concept is reinforced over and over again, the athlete can comprehend how to use BOTH sides of the body and every limb as a major contributor to the entire movement. The Back When referring to the back in the rotational shot put technique, we are discussing the starting position all the way to the long leg sweep to the center. The goal out of the back of the circle is to initiate the throw. Start with a basic and simple winding position, the left arm will get in line with the right leg and then open the left shoulder. As the left shoulder opens long, out past the left leg, the left hip will begin to open. When the left hip and knee and foot open to 90 degrees, 70% of the weight of the body should be over the left side. This is the point when the right leg will be used to push force into the ground and lead to a wide right leg sweep. As the right leg picks up, the high point of the right foot will be very dependent upon the individual. The goal of the right side is to achieve a long sweep position with a dorsiflexed foot and a knee cap pointing to the sky. This lengthened position will help the groin get lengthened just prior to sweeping to the center of the circle! As the right leg sweeps past the left leg, the left leg will pick up and begin to sweep to the front and that is where we enter the middle of the circle! The Middle One concept that is NEVER discussed or taught is the concept of a secondary sweep leg. The secondary sweep leg is the left leg passing the right side in the middle. This secondary sweep leg becomes the primary mover through the middle of the circle. When thinking and analyzing technique from a side around side perspective, the left side becomes active while the right side holds. When the right leg grounds, the right ANKLE must be stiff and the right knee must be flexed. Ideally, there will be a line from the foot to the knee to the chest while the left arm holds either across the body or toward the back of the circle. By holding strong trunk tension, a stiff ankle and a stiff knee, the right side sets up as a passive point of rotation. This rotation will be guided by the action of the left leg to the front. As the left leg sweeps to the front, the hip will begin to open just prior to grounding. The Front The final position of the throw is in the front of the circle. As the left leg is rotating to the front of the circle, the left arm is holding and the right side has massive tension in the shoulder. JUST PRIOR to the left leg grounding, the left arm opens long toward the sector, there is a massive stretch across the chest from the left arm into the right shoulder. The right knee and right ankle will hold tension and flexion into the concrete and when the left foot lands, the shot should still be behind the right hip. When the left leg grounds, about 70% of the weight will be on the right foot and 30% will be on the left foot. As the left side opens and the right side starts to rotate forward, the percentage will shift where 70-80% of the load will go into the left foot. The goal is to keep the right side grounded as long as possible while the left leg is semi-bent and the left foot is nearly flat. This creates a perfect point of deceleration as the right side accelerates rapidly. Remember that the side around side movement is key on the finish. The finish also needs to utilize the left arm, the right shoulder, the left leg as a point of deceleration, and a strong tension into a right leg for an optimal rotation! Recap By comprehending the throw from a side around side movement, the technique becomes easier to comprehend and the movement is triggered by ALL FOUR limbs in the throw. By using all four limbs to execute a throw, throwers become more coordinated and more precise in their movement. This ultimately leads to greater comprehension of technique and longer throws!






Rotational Shot Put Technique Explained March 24, 2021 The shot put event originates from heavy stone throwing competitions in England and Scotland during the 15th century and was included in the first modern Olympiad of 1896 in Athens. Today there are two main techniques used, a linear movement which is a backwards shift across the circle and the non-linear or rotational technique. Advert Think of all throws having three phases, a beginning, middle and end and in each phase there are several sections. In the case of the following linear technique the beginning is the stand and sit followed by the middle, the glide and turn, and the end is the delivery. For the rotational shot the beginning is the pre-flight, the middle the take off and transition and the end is the release Within these sections are the behaviour goals we are looking to achieve in pursuit of good technique. The key to being successful at both techniques is to develop good rhythm i.e.1-2,3 turn the feet and punch the shot, with the angle of delivery slightly lower in the rotational shot The following sequences are written for a right-handed thrower (12 o’clock is the back of the circle, so the front is 6) Pre-Flight Stand at the back of the circle facing 12 with feet just slightly more than shoulder width apart Hold the shot in the right hand with an even finger spread with thumb on downside Do not hold in the palm of the hand, but instead on the fingers The elbow of the throwing arm should be at shoulder height in the 12/3 position i.e. face & chest looking at 12 and the elbow pointing to 3 Think neck-ball-elbow in line (shot is often held a tad higher in the neck than with the linear technique) Maintaining this position until delivery will help the force generated go in the direction of the throw Slowly shift body weight onto the right foot rotating the shoulders so the right elbow is pointing between 6 & 7 and the shoulders are parallel to the ground Then allow body weight to pivot back onto the left foot (toes) and move to 80–90% of normal height i.e. move from high to low shifting body weight from the right foot to the left foot by actively turning the left foot Don’t lead with the left arm, instead allow the right leg to come around the body Right foot needs to be picked up before the right shoulder passes Keep the right shoulder behind the right hip Take Off Long sweeping right leg into the flight phase Wider radius gives better angular momentum at take off Increase height in flight phase will mean dropping onto the right leg will require good leg strength Lead the right foot forward into a step forward Don’t look down at feet, instead use a personal horizon Push off the left foot and step into middle of circle (falling) with gaze looking forward Trunk is more upright than glide technique Transition At rear (right) foot touch down the right knee needs to be greatly flexed and grounds the foot causing athlete to both turn and lift while in single support The shorter the time between rear foot touch down & front (left) foot touch down will allow maximal effort, too early or late will result in inefficient use of power Once the right foot lands keep it turning throughout the throw and allow the left leg to come underneath and ground. i.e. sweep the left (block) leg back on the turn (knees should pass by close together) The left foot needs to be grounded with the rhythm of 1-2,3 Then allow the right foot to continue moving until shot is 180ْ   from release at which point drop the left heel to form the block 70-80% of release velocity achieved in final delivery, so this movement needs to be very explosive and fast Important that the head remains passive so that shoulders and trunk rotate around the head (core movement) do not strike with the head Release The block leg should be stiff on delivery Horizontal release point needs to be as far in front of the stop board as possible without falling (20-40cm for elite athletes) Optimal angle of release Elite 42% Higher the angle reduces the release velocity Research suggests 32-38 is best angle Because of the forces generated, most athletes have to perform a reverse by bringing the right foot forward just after the critical point of the delivery to ensure the throw is not fouled.

Keep shoulders level.  Body drops and left knee/ shin angle bends.  Right leg sweeps from inside the leg not foot.  Left foot drives to right sector line, but should not pass the middle of the sector. 1st Single Support - Drive Phase  The right leg drives from outside into the center of the circle.  Right knee lifts, foot comes under the knee.  The action of stopping the left foot rotation along with the drive of the right leg creates separation.(don’t turn off left)  The bend of the left knee is maintained to aid in landing the left foot at the front quickly. NON SUPPORT/FLIGHT  Left foot leaves the rear of the circle once the right foot passes the left foot in single support.

The rotational technique, also known as the "spin" or "rotational spin," in shot put is an advanced throwing style that leverages the principles of rotational motion to generate more power and achieve a longer throw. This method is preferred by many elite shot putters because it allows for the generation of angular momentum, which can translate into greater linear speed during the release of the shot. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the rotational shot put technique:
1. Preparation and Stance
Starting Position: The athlete begins at the back of the throwing circle, typically facing the rear of the circle, with their back towards the throwing direction.
Foot Position: The feet are shoulder-width apart, with the right foot (for a right-handed thrower) slightly ahead of the left. The weight is predominantly on the right foot.
Shot Position: The shot is held in the throwing hand, resting against the neck and underneath the jaw. The elbow is kept high, and the non-throwing arm is used for balance.
2. Wind-Up and Initiation of Rotation
Initial Wind-Up: The athlete performs a slight backward movement (rocking motion) to create momentum and coil their body. This involves turning the torso and bending the knees to lower the center of gravity.
Rotation Start: The right leg initiates the turn. The athlete pivots on the ball of the right foot while simultaneously driving the left leg to the left, creating a powerful rotational movement. The left arm helps to lead the body in the rotation.
3. Drive Across the Circle
Rotation in the Center: As the thrower spins, they transfer weight from the right leg to the left leg. The right leg drives across the circle, while the left leg helps maintain balance and continues the rotational movement.
Maintaining Low Position: The athlete stays low to the ground with bent knees, enabling a powerful upward push later on. The torso remains coiled to store rotational energy.
Right Foot Pivot: The right foot lands near the center of the circle, pivoting quickly to face the throwing direction, while the left leg extends outward for balance.
4. Power Position Setup
Positioning for Release: As the right foot lands, the athlete shifts into the "power position." In this phase, the right leg is bent and ready to drive upward, while the left foot is grounded for stability.
Hips and Shoulders Alignment: The torso remains coiled, with the shoulders still facing away from the throwing direction. The hips begin to rotate ahead of the shoulders to "unwind" the stored rotational energy.
Left Arm Guidance: The left arm is used as a guide, moving towards the target to help maintain balance and add to the rotational force.
5. Delivery and Release
Explosive Hip Rotation: The athlete explosively uncoils the hips, followed by the shoulders, as they drive the right leg upward and push off with the left leg. The shot is propelled forward using the entire body's momentum.
Arm Extension: The throwing arm extends fully as the shot is released. The wrist flicks to add extra spin to the shot, helping it travel in a stable trajectory.
Angle of Release: The ideal release angle for the shot is typically around 37-42 degrees, maximizing distance. The athlete’s head remains up, and their focus is on the throwing direction.
6. Follow-Through
Maintaining Balance: After the release, the athlete continues to rotate their body, stepping forward with the left foot to maintain balance and avoid fouling the throw.
Controlled Landing: The right foot lands first in the throwing area, followed by the left to prevent stepping outside the circle.
Key Elements for Success
Footwork and Balance: Proper footwork is essential in the rotational technique. Maintaining balance while generating rotation is crucial for a powerful throw.
Core Strength: A strong core helps in generating and transferring rotational energy efficiently.
Speed of Rotation: Faster rotational speed increases the shot’s velocity at release, enhancing throw distance.
Angle and Timing: The correct release angle and timing of hip and shoulder rotation are critical to maximizing the throw's distance.
The rotational technique requires significant coordination and practice but can produce greater distances than the traditional glide technique when executed correctly.
